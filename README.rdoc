== Installing Bareb on your server

=== Step 1: Database

Create a new database and user with full permissions to that database. You can use mysql or postgresql.


=== Step 2: Servlet container

Install Apache Tomcat (or another java servlet container) and make sure you can get to the default installation home page. How to install Tomcat or some other servlet container is beyond the scope of these instructions but the basic details can be found in the {documentation}[http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-7.0-doc/]. Don't be afraid of all those XML configuration files in Tomcat; mostly they can be left to default values.

There is one file you will need to edit and that is context.xml. This file defines all the configuration for your application. Copy the {example}[https://github.com/ari/Bareb/blob/master/config/context.example.xml] into the tomcat configuration folder and set all the variables to reasonable choices for your system. 


== Step 3: Install Bareb

After all that setup we can now install the software. Just take the file ROOT.war from the {github release}[https://github.com/ari/Bareb/releases] and copy it into the webapps folder inside tomcat. If you ever need to upgrade in the future, just replace that one file.


== Step 4: Connect

Open a web browser and connect to your Bareb server. The default user is "admin" and password is "password". Remember to change the password for this user or disable it.


=== Optional: Set up email receiving

When Bareb sends outgoing emails for task updates, they will have a reply address which looks like this:

  davidalmamail@zoho.com

If a user hits reply to that email, you want it to be appended to the task comments. Here's how to set this up for sendmail; adapt the script for your own mail server. Mail can be running on a different server to Bareb because we use HTTP to push the mail from your mail server to Bareb.

==== Sendmail

Add an entry to /etc/mail/local-host-names for your hostname:

  @acme.domain.com.au

Add an entry to /etc/mail/aliases to create an alias that will hand off emails to a script

  Bareb: "|/usr/local/share/Bareb/mail_script.sh"

Add an entry to /etc/mail/virtusertable to redirect all emails to your domain to the above alias

  @acme.domain.com.au        Bareb

run "make; make restart" in /etc/mail to rebuild the sendmail databases.

Now create a script at /usr/local/share/Bareb/mail_script.sh with the following contents

    #!/bin/sh
    SECRET=password1234
    URL=https://acme.domain.com.au/emails
    cat $2 | /usr/local/bin/curl -s -k --data-urlencode secret=${SECRET} --data-urlencode email@- ${URL}

Make sure you change the password and you make it the same as the password in the context.xml file.


== Debugging

=== Accessing Rails console and rake commands

It is now possible to access Rails console in Java environment

    cd path/to/directory/WEB-INF/
    RAILS_ENV=production bash ./script/jruby_jar_exec ./script/rails console

Or run rake

    RAILS_ENV=production bash ./script/jruby_jar_exec rake notes

*NOTE*: It is important that rake is *not* already present in +PATH+.
